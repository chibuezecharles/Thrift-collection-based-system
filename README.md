# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

About the project:
Your task (should you choose to accept it) is to design a thrift collection-based system that manages 
members' monthly savings. 
Use Case: Semako Thrifting Union needs a system to manage members monthly collections (Thrift 
Collection system) 
The company wants to be able to: 
i. Allow members to create accounts by providing necessary personal information (e.g., name, 
contact details) and generating a 15-character PIN for them.
ii. Upon logging in, members should see their account details, including their current balance, 
account history, and any active schemes they've enrolled in.
iii. Members should be able to make payments into their accounts using various payment methods 
(e.g., credit/debit cards, bank transfers).
iv. Allow members to view and enroll in different schemes that offer yields and interests.
v. From an admin panel to manage user accounts, view transaction history, and monitor the overall 
system.
vi. Deduct maintenance fees and admin fees from member accounts as per the system's rules and 
schedules.
vii. Ensure transparent communication with members about fee deductions.
viii. Design pages to illustrate the flows in the items above. (Use your discretion and come up with 
different schemes, rules and schedules.).
ix. Implement secure user authentication mechanisms to protect member accounts.
x. Implement logic for calculating and displaying scheme-specific information, such as interest rates 
and maturity dates.
xi. Implement the ability for admins to add, modify, or delete schemes, as well as set interest rates 
and fees.
xii. Implement a notification system to alert members about important updates, such as successful 
payments, upcoming scheme maturity, or fee deductions.
xiii. You can use dummy data to showcase how you consume endpoints.
Acceptance Criteria
i. Use React, Redux Only. Framework NOT allowed. 
ii. Each component should be classified into earnings and deductions. iii. Expected 
payroll components are basic, transport, housing, pension, tax etc. 
Task Requirements
I. We are on the lookout for the project structure, state management, and design pattern, among 
other things. 
II. Convert the problem above to a 1-2 page(front-end) technical spec. The specification should 
describe how you intend to implement the solution. This document will change overtime and 
should be up to date with the latest/final version of the implementation.
